NEmu is a "New EMUlator" (because I want to make it rather new, whatever that
means) or "Not an EMUlator" (because it's not really an emulator, but a JIT/
dynamic recompiler for code from one target to another).

The goal of it is to experiment with some fancy ideas like single universal
intermediate representation for the code, or descriptive (rather than
code-driven) approach to guest boxes definition.

However currently nearly nothing works.
